// Stripping Names: 
//Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. 
//Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, 
//so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

//assigning variables with some space using \t
//let myFirstName:string
let myFirstName = "Faisal";
let myLastName = "Peerzada";

// printing name in new line

// printing name with space
